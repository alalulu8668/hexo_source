A real-time Oscilloscope also called a "single shot" scope, it captures an entire waveform on each trigger even. A large number of points are captured in one continous record. [1](http://cp.literature.agilent.com/litweb/pdf/5989-8794EN.pdf) To beeter understand, it is like a fast analog-to-digital converter (ADC), in this case, the sample rate determins the sampling space and memory depth determines points that collected and displayed. In this case, it means that the sample rate need to be much faster than the frequency of the incoming waveform, can be up to 80GSa/s or more, and bandwidth has reached 63Ghz.
