I am on period today... So that is easy to explain why I want to blah blah so much. I'm thinking about why wrote this blog, there must be some reason so I can continue. Something like moving on the next step for working cause I just had a IPM meeting with my manager, she talks nicely and encouraged quite little. Made me thinking that I should think more about my career, not just finish daily work and tasks. 
Again, to make everything clear, I always need some kind of list to see my going. Anyway, I'm not feeling well today, I do not need to talk very well either. Gonna drink more hot water and brown sugar with ginger I guess... 

I'm still reading *Moon and the sixpence*. Hopefully to finish it within this week. What I should do with my Svenska!!!!!! OMG!!!
可以写中文吗？中文字体是什么？
