# Task for today

Today is the 5th year I came to Sweden, Stockholm. I hope I can become better and better in myself and my everything. Some tasks for today.

 - Understand Optical power, average and peak power. And corresponding calculation.
 - Verify the code for RRU2217, check the code for set rx and set tx as well.
 - Meeting at 12:00 with Carl for DSX-5000.
 - Go to gym for training.

## **Optical Power**
Total power, average power, peak power, what is the meaning for them? How to calculate and the relationship between them
> Question from ResearchGate [How to count total power from OSA](https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_can_I_count_the_total_power_of_the_light_from_the_power_spectrum_measured_by_the_OSA)

### 1. Peak power and Average power
[Tutorial](https://www.newport.com/medias/sys_master/images/images/h8f/h7a/8797052108830/Average-and-Peak-Power-Calculation-Tech-Note-1.pdf)

In general speaking, Average power is the laser output power from the light souce. The value depend on the souce, e.x, LED souce or other different source. See [introduction](http://www.coherent.com/downloads/aboutmeasuringlaserpowerndenergyoutputfinal.pdf)

### 2. Optical spectral power
Optical spectrum analysis is the measurement of optical power as a function of wavelength. See description [here](http://cp.literature.agilent.com/litweb/pdf/5963-7145E.pdf)

### 3. RJ45 Standards
**ISO/IEC 11801:1995**
![Channel and permanent link description](/images/channel1.jpg)
- define the channel and permanent link
- Channel excludes the connections at application-specific equipment
- Permanent link is the transmission path includes connections at the ends of linstalled cabling.
- No define for patch cord cable

**ANSI/TIA/EIA-568:A**

- clause 6.6, define cord cable, `IL`, `RL`
- clause 6.8, define connectors, `IL`, `RL`, `NEXT`, `FEXT`
- clause 6.9, define cable assembles (patch cord, work area cables), `RL`, `NEXT`
