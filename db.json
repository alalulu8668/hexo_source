What is the difference and relationship between? \nAccording to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_form-factor_pluggable_transceiver#cite_note-15):\nSFP+ modules can be described as 'limiting' or 'linear' types; this describes the functionality of the inbuilt electronics. \n- Limiting SFP+ modules include a signal amplifier to re-shape the (degraded) received signal whereas linear ones do not. \n- Linear modules are mainly used with the low bandwidth standards such as [10GBASE-LRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Gigabit_Ethernet#10GBASE-LRM); otherwise, limiting modules are preferred.\n<!-- more-->\n\n\n## SFP+ design\nA detail explaination of limiting and linear module are descripbed in the article [*The road to SFP+: Examining module and system architectures*](http://www.lightwaveonline.com/articles/2008/01/the-road-to-sfp-examining-module-and-system-architectures-54884162.html). \nSee below figure\n\n\nCurrent Module, `Limiting Module` variant, includes a laser driver, a TOSA, a ROSA, and a **limiting amplifier**. The other variant, `Linear Module`, is majorly intended for 10G Ethernet LRM applications, requires a linear optical receiver path. The third is `Retimed Module` which is compliant with SFP+, it integrates CDR funtionality within the Tx and/or Rx path and resolves signal integrity challenges to many high-speed systems.\n{% asset_img sfpdesign.png Three variants of SFP+ design %}\n\n## Trasmission Design\nIn transmit direction, there is no difference between limiting and linear module. SFP specification has not requirement for ASIC/SerDes but only at point B. More information check [link](http://www.lightwaveonline.com/articles/2008/01/the-road-to-sfp-examining-module-and-system-architectures-54884162.html).\n\n## Receive Design\nIn receive direction, three variants are significantly differ.\n\n- **Limiting interface**, a binary 1/0 decision is made in amplitude but not in time.
